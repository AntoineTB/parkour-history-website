<p>
    Here I track the money invested in this project.
    My own time is not tracked and I have not (yet?) received compensation in any form for this project.
</p>
<p>
    The archive contains no pirated content: all paid content (ie movies) was paid for.
    Lots of content was obtained for free, when it was legally accessible as such, for example on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
    Currencies are a pain to convert, so I don't do that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p>
    Also, the list of transactions is maintained manually, so this may be some months old.
    The underlying data can be found <a href='/money_raw'>here</a>
</p>

<h2>
    Capex / Opex
</h2>

The expenses are roughly divided between:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>capex</b>
        <ul>
            <li>buying content to archive</li>
            <li>supporting creators through Patreon</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>opex</b>
        <ul>
            <li>how much money is spent keeping this website alive</li>
            <li>storage costs for the archive</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I care about this distinction because opex is not money that goes to creators.
    Given the choice I'd MUCH rather see the budget go to the parkour community than some bills.
