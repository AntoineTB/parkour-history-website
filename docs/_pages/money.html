<p>
    Here I track the money I've invested in this project. My own time is not tracked and I have not received compensation in any form for this project.
    Similarly, the archive contains no pirated content, all paid content (ie movies) was paid for.
</p>

<p>
    The expenses are roughly divided between capex (ie buying content to archive, supporting creators through Patreon, etc.)
    and opex (how much money is spent keeping this project alive).
    The goal is to maximize the ratio of capex to opex.
