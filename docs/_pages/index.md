Videos are the core of parkour's culture. They shape how we move and how we share movement. Parkour History is creating an archive of all the parkour videos so that none are lost and so that our culture lasts.

As a community and culture, parkour has put all its eggs in too few baskets. Centralized platforms like YouTube (Google) and Instagram (Facebook) host our content for free, but also with no guarantees. Those close gardens have their own interest at heart and may delete our videos whenever they please, without notice. They've shown again and again that they are greedy and conservative.

## Why?

In early 2019 Youtube [demonetized STORROR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-fTJ2UWJ4I). The reason this was done is the same reason why Tumblr banned adult content in 2018, why MindGeek deleted all content from non-verified user in 2020, and why YouTube frequently deletes historical footage or videos that contain criminal evidence: the advertisers and payment processors, who are the ones injecting and processing money into those platforms do not want to be associated with criminal or moraly repehensible content.

While parkour is not criminal per say, it is often performed on private property and rooftops, on top of looking dangerous, especially on successfull channels. This is enough to have it flagged as borderline unacceptable content, which leads to demonetization and maybe even content removal.

Furthermore, copyright law is broken and YouTube's system is barely any better. This also leads to video takedowns, which looks like this:

Parkour History is not pushing for parkour athletes to move out of YouTube and Instagram. While the issues with those platforms will most probably not go away, it might also not become worse. In the meantime they offer an incredible opportunity for athletes to connect with a global fanbase and showcase their work for free.

## So what does Parkour History do?

Parkour History is building an archive. Humans are tasked with curating parkour videos and bots go over all of them to download them and save them in a long-term storage archiving solution. As the project grows, multiple archiving solutions might be spun up in parallel for resiliency. Archived videos are not redistributed but can be accessed on demand and can be rehosted elsewhere in case of a takedown. More than {{ site.data.snapshot.archivedVideosCount }} videos are now archived in this manner, with more added every day. It would take {{ site.data.snapshot.totalRuntime.hours }} hours to watch the archive back to back.

Currently the bot only works with YouTube videos. Instagram is the next target for development.

The archive also support manual uploads, notably to hosts feature-length parkour movies and things that are not in video format.
